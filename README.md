# FPS-BOOSTER
This FPS booster optimizes windows by closing "Un-needed" applications, and utilizing the GPU performance and clearing RAM. Memory clearing software will be added in the future if i have time. If you have a issue please report it to the issues tab.

By the way it stays at around 80 FPS during regular desktop because I dont want your computer to blow up. Also you might need to turn off your anti virus or make a exclusion for the build maker for some reason because i build it in real time and it is detected as maleware but it is made by microsft LOL or it wont work at all. If you have any issues just reach out to me if you need help with the program or want to contribute. 

New to github so bare with me with this long text.
